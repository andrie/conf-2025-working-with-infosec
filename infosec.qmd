## Working with Infosec {.hidetitle}

# The great idea


## The thrill of building a great app

# Don't ask for forgiveness



<!-- ## Don't ask for forgiveness, ask for permission. -->

## You've made something cool / great

## An AI is especially powerful if it touches multiple data sources

- Mixing SFDC and zendesk
- You can easily expose secrets this way

## There is good reason why InfoSec will put on the brakes
- Create read-only copy of the data you actually work with
- The danger comes when you push the modified data back into production


# Change your mindset

## Don't ask for forgiveness, ask for permission

- A good InfoSec team will not try to block you, but to enable
- But they need to protect the company and assets of the company

## Start the conversation as early as possible

- Once you realise your bot will touch production data

## Think ahead to working with the least amount of access

- This will increase design time
- But reduce risk and make it easier to pass the hurdles
- Don't provide admin access if you don't need it


# Human factors are real!
<!-- Put the line of tension here! -->



# With these steps in mind you can work IT!

- There are really good reasons to be careful
- Following these will make your life easier

# Iâ€™m not claiming this is as easy as I say

<!-- Find the moment of tension -->
You probably have PTSD from decades of being blocked by IT
